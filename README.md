# UDPTCPBankingSystem
Created a full-blown UDP server with MD5 Authentication using a 4-step handshake between the client and server. Basically, the client requests to connect to the server. The server generates a 64-character string, and then sends it to the client. The client computes a hash with the username, password, and challenge string, and sends it to the server. The server then computes its own hash with the username and password stored in its so-called database, and checks the hash value. If they match, the user is authenticated, if they don't match, the user is not authenticated. Future features include attaching a session key to the client and allowing the client to deposit or withdraw money from the clients respective account.
